## EXERCISE COMPLETE (`02-FinishedLesson`)

This step simply displays the completed [`ITCB/src/Shared/internal/ITCB_SDK_Central_internal_Callbacks.swift`](https://github.com/ChrisMarshallNY/ITCB-master/tree/master/02-FinishedLesson/SDK-src/src/internal/ITCB_SDK_Central_internal_Callbacks.swift) file.

At this point, you should be able to build and run any of the apps (remember that they need to be run **on the device**. Simulators won't work, for Bluetooth).

The apps should work correctly. If you start one app as a Central (any platform), and one as a Peripheral (iOS and MacOS only), you should see the Peripheral appear in the Central list, and be able to ask that Peripheral a question (and receive an answer). You will see some `print()` statement output in the Console.
